## The Arena

Product battle platform: submit a product for free, get auto-paired head-to-head
against another product in your category, first to 100 votes wins. Win 3 duels in a
row and become the category's permanent Champion.

### Stack

- Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript
- Supabase (Postgres) — data + vote-locking
- LemonSqueezy — payments for boost / revive / defend-the-throne
- Tailwind CSS

### Local setup

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a Supabase project**

   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → New project (free tier).
   - In the SQL editor, run the files in `supabase/migrations/` in order:
     `0001_init.sql` creates all six tables (`products`, `matches`, `votes`,
     `champions`, `activity_log`, `payments`) with the constraints, indexes,
     and RLS policies the app relies on (anon clients get read-only access
     to `products`/`matches`/`champions`/`activity_log`; `votes` and
     `payments` are only reachable server-side via the service role key).
     `0002_functions.sql` adds `cast_vote(...)`, a Postgres function that
     atomically records a vote and increments the match's counter.
     `0003_uncontested.sql` adds the columns behind the waiting-for-a-
     challenger feature. `0004_boost.sql` adds `boost_votes(...)`, the same
     atomic-increment pattern for paid boosts. `0005_unique_products.sql`
     adds the `unique` product status and corrects any wins/streaks/champion
     crownings that were previously (incorrectly) granted just for going
     uncontested — see "How wins and the leaderboard work" below.
     `0006_battle_pitch.sql` adds the optional Battle Pitch fields
     (`battle_pitch`, `why_us`, `differentiators`), an optional founder
     `x_handle`, and `edit_token_hash` (a hashed one-time token that lets a
     submitter edit their own product later — see "Battle Pitch, search,
     and founder X handles" below).
   - Grab your Project URL, `anon` public key, and `service_role` secret key
     from Project Settings → API.

3. **Create a LemonSqueezy store**

   - Go to [lemonsqueezy.com](https://lemonsqueezy.com) → create a store.
   - Create three products/variants: Boost ($5), Revive ($10), Defend the
     Throne ($20). Each variant's ID is in its product settings page URL —
     these go in `LEMONSQUEEZY_BOOST_VARIANT_ID` /
     `LEMONSQUEEZY_REVIVE_VARIANT_ID` / `LEMONSQUEEZY_DEFEND_VARIANT_ID`.
   - Grab your API key (Settings → API) and Store ID (also Settings → API,
     or in the store switcher) for `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` /
     `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID`.
   - Once deployed, create a webhook at Settings → Webhooks pointed at
     `<your-deployed-url>/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`, subscribed to at least
     the `order_created` event. Paste the signing secret it gives you into
     `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

4. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

   Fill in the values from steps 2–3. See `.env.local.example` for the full
   list of variable names.

5. **Run the dev server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Project structure

```
src/
  app/                 # Next.js App Router pages & route handlers
  lib/supabase/
    client.ts          # anon-key client (read-only, RLS-enforced)

```

### Build status

- **Phase 1 (done):** project scaffold, Supabase schema/migrations, env setup.
- **Phase 2 (done):** core arena UI — submission, auto-pairing, matchups,
  voting with real vote-locking (DB unique constraint + signed visitor
  cookie), win-streak/elimination/champion-crowning logic, eliminated list,
  Hall of Fame, activity feed. State refreshes via a 5s poll of `/api/state`.
- **Phase 3 (done):** LemonSqueezy checkout + webhook-gated boost/revive/defend.
- **Phase 4 (done):** public product pages + embeddable champion badge.
- **Phase 5 (done):** polish — mobile, empty/loading states, anti-spam.

### How voting/pairing works (Phase 2)

- Submitting is always free (`POST /api/products`) and immediately triggers
  pairing: any 2+ active, unmatched products in the same category are
  matched into a new duel.
- Voting (`POST /api/votes`) sets a signed, httpOnly `arena_vid` cookie on
  first vote and hashes it (with `FINGERPRINT_SALT`) before storing it — the
  DB's unique `(match_id, voter_fingerprint)` constraint is the real
  enforcement of "1 vote per visitor per duel," not just client-side UI
  state. A lightweight in-memory IP rate limiter also caps request bursts
  (best-effort only — resets on cold start, not shared across instances).
- Reaching 100 votes on a side resolves the match: the winner's streak
  increments (crowning a Champion at 3 in a row) and the loser is
  eliminated. The winner is then re-entered into the pairing pool unless
  they were just crowned.
- A product alone in its category (no one to pair against) is shown as
  "Waiting for a challenger" with a one-tap copyable invite link
  (`/?join=<category>&from=<name>`) that pre-selects that category and
  shows a banner when someone follows it — the intended growth loop for a
  lone early submitter.

#### How wins and the leaderboard work

A product's `wins`/streak can ONLY be incremented in one place:
`applyWin()` in `src/lib/arena.ts`, called from `resolveMatchIfComplete()`
after one side of a real, live duel actually reaches the 100-vote
threshold. No other code path touches `wins`.

- **Waiting for Challenger** — a newly submitted (or freshly re-paired)
  product with no rival yet. `wins` stays untouched, and it's excluded from
  the Leaderboard.
- **No rival after 7 days** — previously this silently granted a "win" for
  simply waiting (the old 24h uncontested-advance). That's gone. Now the
  product is just marked `unique` ("Unique Product") — still fully
  challengeable via the same invite link, still shown publicly, but
  `wins`/streak are never touched and it never appears on the Leaderboard.
  The moment a rival becomes available, `pairUnmatchedProducts()` pairs it
  into a real duel and flips it back to `active`.
- **Live duel** — while a duel is in progress, neither side's `wins` changes
  and neither is shown as a "winner," no matter the current vote lead.
- **Completed duel** — the only way to actually earn a win: reach the vote
  threshold before the opponent. The winner's streak increments (crowning a
  Champion at 3 in a row); the loser is eliminated with streak reset to 0.

The Leaderboard (`Leaderboard.tsx`, backed by `topProducts` in
`getArenaState()`) only ever queries products with `wins > 0`, so it can
only ever show real, completed-duel win streaks — never waiting time,
uncontested status, or a live vote lead.

There's no cron for the 7-day check — it's checked lazily on every
`/api/state` fetch, which the client already polls every 5s.

### Battle Pitch, search, and founder X handles

- **Battle Pitch** — every product can optionally add a Battle Pitch (≤120
  chars), a "Why Us?" line (≤160 chars), and up to 3 short differentiators
  (`src/lib/product-fields.ts` validates all of it, shared by both create
  and edit). `BattlePitch.tsx` renders the block and returns `null` when a
  product hasn't filled any of it in — the card's existing `pitch`
  description is the fallback, nothing is invented. It's wired into
  `MatchCard`'s `SideCard` (so it shows in every live duel, never a
  hardcoded matchup) and the product page.
- **Editing** — there's no account system, so ownership is a one-time edit
  token: `POST /api/products` generates one, returns it in plaintext exactly
  once, and the client stores it in `localStorage` (same pattern as the
  anonymous voter fingerprint in `lib/fingerprint.ts`, just for edit access
  instead of vote-locking). `PATCH /api/products/[id]` re-hashes whatever
  token is presented and compares it to `edit_token_hash` — no match, no
  edit. `ProductEditor.tsx` on the product page reads that token from
  `localStorage` and simply doesn't render an "Edit" affordance if it's
  absent, which is also why every pre-`0006` product is fixed as originally
  submitted: it never had a token to begin with.
  - **24h edit window** (`lib/edit-window.ts`) — editing closes 24h after
    submission, enforced in `PATCH /api/products/[id]` itself (not just
    hinted at client-side), so Battle Pitch/Why Us/differentiators/X handle
    can't be rewritten mid-duel in reaction to how voting is going. Editing
    never touches votes, wins, or match state regardless of window, so this
    is purely about when informational fields can change, not about the
    battle's outcome.
  - **`EditProductButton.tsx`** — a small pencil icon shown on every card
    (duel cards, waiting/eliminated/champion cards) that renders `null`
    unless *this exact browser* holds that product's edit token AND it's
    still within the 24h window — everyone else, including every other
    voter on that same duel, sees nothing there. It links to
    `/product/[id]?edit=1#edit-product`, which auto-expands the existing
    `ProductEditor` rather than duplicating the edit form inline in every
    card variant.
- **Search** — `GET /api/search?q=` does a server-side `ilike` search
  across name/pitch/category/x_handle (never loads the full product list
  into the browser), sanitizing the query so it can't be read as `.or()`
  filter syntax or an `ilike` wildcard pattern. `ProductSearchBar` (desktop,
  inline in the header) and `ProductSearchToggle` (mobile, a full-screen
  overlay portaled to `document.body` — see the comment in
  `ProductSearch.tsx` for why it can't just render inline under the
  backdrop-blurred header) share the same 300ms-debounced hook and
  loading/no-results/error states.
- **Founder X handle** — optional, normalized to a bare username (no `@`,
  validated against X's handle rules) in `lib/x-handle.ts`, never fetched or
  verified via the X API. `XHandleLink` renders "Built by @handle" linking
  to the profile, and renders nothing at all when a product has no handle.

### How payments work (Phase 3)

- `POST /api/checkout` creates a LemonSqueezy checkout server-side (via
  their REST API, using `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY`) and returns the hosted
  checkout URL. The client opens it in LemonSqueezy's overlay
  (`assets.lemonsqueezy.com/lemon.js`, loaded in the root layout). This
  route does an early, friendly legality check (is the match still active /
  is the product actually eliminated or a non-defending champion) but it
  **grants nothing** — it only starts a checkout.
- The product/match id and action type are passed through as `custom_data`
  on the checkout and echoed back verbatim in the webhook payload — that's
  how a confirmed payment gets tied back to what it paid for.
- `POST /api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy` is the only place a boost/revive/defend
  is ever actually granted. It verifies the `X-Signature` header (HMAC-
  SHA256 over the raw body with `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) before
  touching anything, then only acts on a `status: "paid"` `order_created`
  event. The `payments` table's unique constraint on
  `lemonsqueezy_order_id` makes this idempotent against webhook retries —
  a duplicate delivery is a no-op, not a double-grant.
  - **Retry-safe grant application**: a payment is inserted as `"pending"`
    *before* the grant is applied, and only flipped to `"completed"` after
    `applyBoost`/`applyRevive`/`applyDefend` succeeds. If applying the
    grant throws, the handler returns a non-2xx status so LemonSqueezy
    retries the delivery, and the retry resumes from the existing
    `"pending"` row instead of treating the order as already handled. Only
    a `"completed"` row short-circuits a redelivery. Those three functions
    also now throw on a real Supabase/RPC error instead of silently
    no-oping — a paid boost/revive/defend can no longer vanish with zero
    trace if a DB call transiently fails.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (used for the checkout redirect, share links,
    and the badge) now falls back to the actual incoming request's origin
    (`lib/site-url.ts`) instead of a hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` — a
    missing/stale env var in production can no longer silently send a
    real visitor's post-checkout redirect to localhost.
- Boost re-derives which side of the match to credit from the match row
  itself (never trusts a client-supplied side) and applies via a
  `boost_votes()` Postgres function — same atomic-increment pattern as
  voting. Revive/defend are applied via conditional updates
  (`.eq("status", "eliminated")` / `.eq("status", "champion")`) so a
  delayed or retried webhook can't stomp on state that's already moved on
  (e.g. a product that won its way back to Champion before a stale revive
  webhook arrives).
- Defending the throne (`is_defending: true`) re-enters a champion into the
  pool needing 3 fresh wins; winning while defending increments the
  existing `champions` row's `times_defended` instead of crowning a new
  entry. Losing while defending eliminates them like any other duel loss.

### Public product pages + champion badge (Phase 4)

- `/product/[id]` — public page for any submitted product: status, pitch,
  link, category, and full duel history (win/loss + score, newest first).
  A crowned product also shows when it was crowned, times defended, and
  (only while still reigning) its embed snippet.
- `/api/badge/[id]` — server-rendered SVG badge (`image/svg+xml`, 1h cache),
  404s for anything that isn't currently a champion. Self-contained dark
  card with the accent color, so it looks the same regardless of the host
  site's theme.
- The embed snippet is a plain `<a><img></a>` pointed at the badge endpoint
  and the product's `/product/[id]` page — the intended backlink loop from
  every champion's site back to the Arena.

### Design system

Premium, editorial, non-gradient: subtle translucent borders (not stark
black/white), soft layered shadows (`--shadow-sm/md/lg`), moderate corner
radius (`rounded-lg`/`rounded-xl`/`rounded-2xl` — no more than a couple of
full-pill shapes), hover elevation (`-translate-y-0.5` + shadow bump) and
`active:scale-95` press feedback. Minimal Lucide icons throughout (no
emoji). Defaults to the OS's `prefers-color-scheme`, with a manual toggle
(sun/moon button in the sticky header) that overrides it — saved to
`localStorage` (`arena_theme`), applied via a `data-theme="light"|"dark"`
attribute on `<html>` set by a small inline script before first paint so
there's no flash of the wrong theme. Tokens in `src/app/globals.css`:

**Brand mark:** two matted PNG variants of the logo (`public/brand/`) —
`icon-light-theme.png` (black accent, for the light/white surface) and
`icon-dark-theme.png` (white accent, for the black surface), same idea for
the full wordmark. Swapped via `--logo-icon`/`--logo-wordmark` CSS
variables using the exact same light/dark/override cascade as every other
color token (`BrandLogo.tsx` just points a `background-image` at the
variable), so it needs no JS and can't flash the wrong variant. The
favicon (`public/favicons/`) follows the same idea but can't be done in
pure CSS — a default light `<link rel="icon">` is set in `layout.tsx`,
corrected to the dark variant by the same before-paint inline script when
applicable, and kept in sync by `ThemeToggle` on every manual toggle.

- Primary surface: white (`#ffffff`) in light mode, black (`#000000`) in
  dark mode — `--bg`, with `--surface`/`--surface-2` as near-neutral card
  tints, `--ink`/`--muted` as text, and `--border`/`--border-strong` as
  low-opacity hairlines (not solid black/white).
- Accent: `#00b4d8` (`--accent`) for primary CTAs/active states/vote
  buttons, `#90e0ef` (`--accent-soft`) for secondary fills (badges, tags,
  subtle washes). `--accent-ink` (black) is the fixed text color on
  accent-colored backgrounds. Used deliberately, not everywhere — most of
  the UI is still black/white/gray.
- `--danger` (`#ff3b30`) + `--danger-ink` (white): the eliminated ribbon
  and the near-loss warning ring — the only non-accent color, reserved for
  elimination/critical states.

**Structure (single-page, anchor-linked nav):** a sticky header
(`SiteHeader`) with logo, nav links that scroll to `#how-it-works`,
`#duels`, `#hall-of-fame`, `#about`, a submit-product page.

**Game-feel details worth knowing:**
- Hero has a low-opacity photographic backdrop (`ArenaBackdrop`):
  `public/backdrop-light.jpeg` (a bright daylight stadium) and
  `public/backdrop-dark.jpeg` (a moody dual-spotlight arena, blue vs. red)
  swapped via the `--backdrop-image`/`--backdrop-opacity` CSS variables in
  `globals.css` — the exact same light/dark/manual-override cascade as the
  brand logo, so it can never flash the wrong image. A gradient overlay
  fades it into the page background at the top and bottom, and a slow
  CSS-only pan/zoom (`backdrop-pan`) keeps it from feeling static, all
  without ever competing with the foreground content sitting on top of it.
- Each duel card (`MatchCard`) shows both competing products as equal-
  weight columns (name, logo-style avatar, category, pitch, win streak,
  vote count + progress bar, its own vote button, its own boost button) —
  desktop side-by-side, mobile stacked with the VS divider preserved
  either way. Voting locks both sides at once: the side you picked gets a
  colored ring, an "✓ Your vote" badge, and a solid "✓ Voted" button; the
  side you didn't pick fades and its button reads "Not selected" — the
  vote and the boost button are always visually tied to a specific named
  product, never ambiguous about which side they belong to. **Near-loss
  state**: when a side's opponent hits 99/100 votes, that side gets a
  soft red ring and its boost button becomes an urgent "one from
  elimination" call to action.
- Vote counts pop with a quick slide-up animation on change (a CSS
  keyframe replayed via `key={votes}`, no animation library).
- Eliminated products (`EliminatedList`) keep a diagonal red "ELIMINATED"
  ribbon, softened into the premium card style (rounded, shadowed,
  slightly faded until hovered).
- The waiting-for-a-challenger card's primary CTA opens a pre-filled X
  share intent ("Invite a Rival"); the same component is reused on a lone
  product's own `/product/[id]` page.
- `Leaderboard` and the homepage stats row (`StatsRow`) are both backed by
  real aggregate queries in `getArenaState()` (product/duel/champion
  counts, votes cast today, top products by current win streak) — nothing
  on the page is a fabricated number. A per-match countdown and per-
  category "round number" from the original visual reference were
  deliberately **not** built: neither has a backing mechanic (matches
  don't expire on a timer, there's no round-numbering concept), and a
  fake one would misrepresent how the arena actually works.
- Sections below the fold (`How it Works`, `Hall of Fame`, `Power Moves`,
  `About`) fade/slide in on scroll via `ScrollReveal` (`IntersectionObserver`
  + a CSS keyframe, no library). The core duel/voting section is not
  scroll-gated, so it's never hidden behind a delay.

### Polish pass (Phase 5)

- **Mobile:** duel cards stack vertically below `sm` instead of squeezing
  two product columns side by side.
- **Loading states:** a root `loading.tsx` (spinner) and a
  `/product/[id]/loading.tsx` (skeleton) cover client-side navigation;
  every action button already had its own inline loading label
  ("Voting…", "Entering the arena…", "Starting checkout…").
- **Error/not-found states:** a branded `error.tsx` (with retry) replaces
  Next's default error overlay if a Supabase call throws, and a branded
  `not-found.tsx` covers both truly unmatched routes and `notFound()` calls
  (e.g. an invalid product id).
- **Anti-spam on submissions:** a honeypot field (invisible to real users,
  present in the DOM for bots that fill everything), a minimum-fill-time
  check (rejects a submission faster than a human could plausibly type
  one), and a case-insensitive duplicate-URL check — on top of the
  existing per-IP rate limit.
- **Anti-spam on votes:** added a per-visitor-fingerprint rate limit
  alongside the existing per-IP one — IP alone can false-positive on
  shared/NAT'd networks, and this also catches a bot that cycles IPs but
  reuses one visitor id.
